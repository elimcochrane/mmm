This repository is for my research project, initially titled "Masculinity, Meaning, and Modernity," and now tentatively titled "Masculinity in Community."

This project examines r/JordanPeterson to understand temporal changes in posts' themes, sentiment, engagement, and volume. Ultimately, I attempt to make sense of changes in gender roles by utilizing discourse analysis and narrative inquiry to get personal accounts of men's expressions of group and personal identity.
